# 🧠 Methodology

The **Portfolio Risk Analytics Engine** combines multiple complementary approaches to estimate market risk under different assumptions and market conditions.

Instead of relying on a single Value-at-Risk methodology, the engine compares **historical, parametric, simulation-based, and volatility-adjusted models**, validates them using statistical backtesting, and complements them with stress testing and portfolio risk attribution.

The following sections summarize the mathematical foundations behind each implemented model.

---

## 1. Portfolio Return Calculation

Individual asset returns are computed using daily log returns:

$$
r_t=\ln\left(\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}\right)
$$

where

- $P_t$ = asset price at time $t$
- $r_t$ = daily log return

Portfolio returns are obtained as the weighted sum of individual asset returns:

$$
r_p=\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{r}
$$

where

- $\mathbf{w}$ = portfolio weight vector
- $\mathbf{r}$ = vector of asset returns

---

## 2. Historical Simulation VaR

Historical Simulation estimates Value-at-Risk directly from observed historical returns without assuming any probability distribution.

The VaR at confidence level $\alpha$ is the empirical lower-tail quantile:

$$
VaR_\alpha=-Q_{1-\alpha}(r_p)
$$

### Advantages

- No distributional assumptions
- Naturally captures skewness and fat tails
- Simple and intuitive

### Limitations

- Assumes the future resembles the past
- Does not adapt to changing market volatility

---

## 3. Expected Shortfall (Conditional VaR)

Expected Shortfall measures the **average loss beyond the VaR threshold**, providing a more informative measure of tail risk.

$$
ES_\alpha
=
-
E
\left[
r_p
\mid
r_p
\le
VaR_\alpha
\right]
$$

Unlike VaR, Expected Shortfall satisfies the properties of a coherent risk measure and captures the severity of extreme losses.

---

## 4. Parametric (Variance-Covariance) VaR

### Gaussian VaR

The variance-covariance approach assumes portfolio returns follow a multivariate normal distribution.

Portfolio volatility is

$$
\sigma_p
=
\sqrt{
\mathbf{w}^T
\Sigma
\mathbf{w}
}
$$

where

- $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix of asset returns.

The one-day VaR is

$$
VaR_\alpha
=
-z_\alpha\sigma_p
$$

where

- $z_\alpha$ is the standard normal quantile.

### Student-t VaR

Financial returns often exhibit **fat tails** that are poorly captured by the Gaussian assumption.

The engine therefore also models returns using a Student's t-distribution:

$$
VaR_\alpha
=
-
t_{\alpha,\nu}
\cdot
\sigma
\sqrt{
\frac{\nu-2}{\nu}
}
$$

where

- $\nu$ = estimated degrees of freedom
- $t_{\alpha,\nu}$ = Student-t quantile

The Student-t parameters are estimated using **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**.

Compared to the Gaussian model, Student-t VaR better captures extreme market events.

---

## 5. Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo VaR estimates portfolio risk by generating thousands of possible future return scenarios.

The engine supports

- Multivariate Gaussian simulation
- Multivariate Student-t simulation

The simulated portfolio return is

$$
r_p^{(i)}
=
\mathbf{w}^T
r^{(i)}
$$

where

$r^{(i)}$

is the simulated asset return vector.

The empirical lower-tail quantile of the simulated portfolio distribution provides the VaR estimate.

### Advantages

- Flexible
- Handles nonlinear portfolios
- Easily extended to alternative distributions

---

## 6. Filtered Historical Simulation (FHS)

Historical Simulation assumes constant volatility.

Filtered Historical Simulation improves this by incorporating a **GARCH(1,1)** volatility model.

The workflow is

1. Fit a GARCH(1,1) model to portfolio returns.
2. Estimate conditional volatility.
3. Standardize historical returns.
4. Bootstrap standardized residuals.
5. Rescale using today's volatility.
6. Compute Historical VaR on the filtered returns.

The conditional variance evolves according to

$$
\sigma_t^2
=
\omega
+
\alpha
\epsilon_{t-1}^2
+
\beta
\sigma_{t-1}^2
$$

where

- $\omega$ = long-run variance
- $\alpha$ = ARCH parameter
- $\beta$ = GARCH parameter

FHS captures volatility clustering and typically produces more reliable VaR forecasts during turbulent market conditions.

---

# 📉 Statistical Backtesting

VaR models should not only estimate risk—they should also be validated.

The engine implements two industry-standard statistical backtests.

---

## 7. Kupiec Proportion of Failures Test

Kupiec's test verifies whether the observed number of VaR breaches matches the expected breach probability.

The likelihood ratio statistic is

$$
LR_{POF}
=
-2
\left(
\ln L_0
-
\ln L_1
\right)
$$

where

- $L_0$ = likelihood under the expected breach rate
- $L_1$ = likelihood under the observed breach rate

A high p-value indicates that the VaR model correctly estimates the expected frequency of losses.

---

## 8. Christoffersen Conditional Coverage Test

A correct VaR model should also produce **independent breaches**.

The Christoffersen test evaluates

- Correct unconditional coverage
- Independence of breaches

using a first-order Markov chain.

Passing both Kupiec and Christoffersen tests indicates a statistically reliable VaR model.

---

# 🌍 Stress Testing

Value-at-Risk estimates losses under normal market conditions.

Stress testing evaluates portfolio performance under extreme market events.

The engine supports two complementary approaches.

### Hypothetical Scenarios

User-defined shocks representing events such as

- Global Financial Crisis
- COVID-19 Shock
- Commodity Crash
- Interest Rate Shock
- Emerging Market Crisis

### Historical Scenario Replay

Historical ETF returns are replayed over major market crises including

- COVID Crash (2020)
- China Slowdown (2015)
- European Debt Crisis (2011)
- Q4 Selloff (2018)
- Rate Hike Cycle (2022)

Unlike hypothetical stress tests, historical replay preserves actual cross-asset correlations observed during each event.

---

# 📊 Portfolio Risk Attribution

Beyond estimating total portfolio risk, the engine decomposes VaR into asset-level contributions.

## Component VaR

Euler allocation decomposes portfolio VaR as

$$
CVaR_i
=
w_i
\frac{\partial VaR}{\partial w_i}
$$

The sum of Component VaRs equals total portfolio VaR.

---

## Marginal VaR

Marginal VaR measures the sensitivity of portfolio VaR to a small increase in an asset's portfolio weight.

$
MVaR_i
=
\frac{\partial VaR}{\partial w_i}
$

This metric identifies which assets contribute most strongly to incremental portfolio risk.

---

## Incremental VaR

Incremental VaR measures the change in portfolio VaR when a position is removed from the portfolio.

$$
IVaR_i
=
VaR_{portfolio}
-
VaR_{without\ i}
$$

Negative Incremental VaR indicates that an asset acts as a **portfolio hedge**, reducing overall portfolio risk.

---

## Summary

By combining multiple complementary risk models, statistical validation techniques, stress testing, and portfolio risk attribution, the engine provides a practical end-to-end framework for market risk analysis inspired by methodologies used in modern financial institutions.
